                    <p class="text-paragraph2 position">Coding and computer programming are always changing and evolving.It’s exciting to think about how we can program computers to do complex things, and to look back into history and see that this has been happening for quite a while. Programmers throughout time have imagined and invented new possibilities with programming and coding, and how they’ve used their skills to make their ideas become a reality.</p>

                        <p class="text-paragraph2 position">Programming dates all the way back to 60 A.D., to the time of Mr. Heron of Alexandria. This fella was a mathematician and engineer who was known for his amazing inventions and machines. There was one machine in particular that perhaps sparked the evolution of computer programming – this specific machine had puppets on it, and underneath the machine were a series of strings that you could pull, to make the puppets do certain things. By simply re-wiring the machine or re-programming the machine, you could manipulate the puppets to do different things. That’s one of the first recorded examples of where you could program or change the way something is operated without having to take it all apart and rebuild it.</p>

                        <p class="text-paragraph2 position" style="text-align:justify">Historians recognise Ada Lovelace as the first computer programmer. Born in 1815, Ada studied mathematics, which at the time was highly unusual for a woman. After meeting Charles Babbage, the inventor of the Analytical Engine, Ada was entranced. In 1843, she published an article about the machine which came to be recognised as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Lovelace’s contribution to coding was just the beginning. In 1923, German military combined coding and electricity, communicating via secret coded messages on the Enigma machine. Alan Turing famously cracked the code, reportedly helping end the war two years earlier than predicted. Turing later took the concept and evolved it, creating a more flexible machine in 1936. </p>
